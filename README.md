The goal of this exercise is to practice testing a Rails Application using RSPEC and Capybara.

Example specs have been setup for Home Page and creating a Location.

Bundle
rake db:create db:migrate


All Specs live in spec/features

Each spec file is named in a way to identify what it is testing.
home page specs live in a file named spec/features/home_page_spec.rb




spec files need to require the following file:
  require 'rails_helper'

Run all specs with command rspec.

Run specific tests with command rspec spec/directory/file_name.rb
  example: spec/features/home_page_spec.rb
